# Lab 2 - Interaction

## Purpose

The interaction is the part of application that enables information exchange between the user and the system. Information exchanges do not only occur between the user and the system but also between components within the application.

You will be working with:

  * Advanced layout with overlapping components
  * Form management and validation
  * Listeners and events

## Task

Create your own version of the application shown below using one of the frameworks from Lab 1.

Additional instructions:

  * The logo of the card must change according to the current card number input, see the linked [executable version](https://codepen.io/JavaScriptJunkie/pen/YzzNGeR) for an example
  * Validate user input when appropriate, for example on numeric fields and maximum input length
  * Similar to the example, "\#"-symbols should be used as placeholders in the card number (note that American Express uses a different card number format)
  * The card element and form element of the interface should partly overlap, as in the example
  * Implement at least one animation in your user interface (you do not need to include all animations shown in the example)

### User interface 2

  * [Executable version (you may reuse the logic)](executable-version)
  * [Pictures to use to the card](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.ida.liu.se/~TDDC73/labs/images.zip)
  * [Information about credit cards and numbers](https://www.creditcardinsider.com/learn/anatomy-of-a-credit-card/)

## Reporting your work

Demonstrate your application for the lab assistant, the assistant may ask you to explain parts of the code. The assistant tells you how they wants you to submit your code.
