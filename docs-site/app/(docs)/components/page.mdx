# Components

Explore the complete component library built entirely from primitive Flutter components.

## Available Components

Primitive UI provides four core components, each demonstrating different aspects of Flutter's rendering system:

### UI Components

- **[CustomCard](/components/custom-card)** - A card component built with CustomPaint, featuring elevation shadows and rounded corners
- **[CustomToggleSwitch](/components/custom-toggle-switch)** - An animated toggle switch with smooth transitions and gesture handling
- **[CustomSlider](/components/custom-slider)** - A slider component for selecting values from a range
- **[CustomCircularProgress](/components/custom-circular-progress)** - An indeterminate circular progress indicator

### Layout Components

- **[HStack](/components/hstack)** - Horizontal stack layout with custom spacing and alignment
- **[VStack](/components/vstack)** - Vertical stack layout with custom spacing and alignment
- **[ZStack](/components/zstack)** - Layered stack for overlapping widgets with alignment control

## Component Categories

### Visual Components
CustomCard and CustomToggleSwitch demonstrate how to use `CustomPaint` and `Canvas` to create custom visual elements with shadows, colors, and animations.

### Layout Components
VStack, HStack, and ZStack show how to implement custom layout logic using `RenderBox` and constraint-based sizing.
