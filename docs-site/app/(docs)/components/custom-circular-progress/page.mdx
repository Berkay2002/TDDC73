# CustomCircularProgress

An indeterminate circular progress indicator. This component demonstrates how to combine `CustomPaint` with an `AnimationController` to create continuous, smooth animations without using high-level widgets like `CircularProgressIndicator`.

## Basic Usage

```dart
CustomCircularProgress()
```

## API Reference

### Constructor

```dart
CustomCircularProgress({
  Key? key,
  Color color = const Color(0xFF2196F3),
  double strokeWidth = 4.0,
  double size = 40.0,
})
```

### Properties

<ApiTable
  data={[
    {
      name: 'color',
      type: 'Color',
      description: 'The color of the progress indicator.',
    },
    {
      name: 'strokeWidth',
      type: 'double',
      description: 'The width of the line used to draw the circle.',
    },
    {
      name: 'size',
      type: 'double',
      description: 'The diameter of the progress indicator.',
    },
  ]}
/>

## Examples

### Custom Size and Color

```dart
CustomCircularProgress(
  color: Colors.orange,
  size: 60.0,
  strokeWidth: 6.0,
)
```

## Implementation Details

The `CustomCircularProgress` is implemented using:

1.  **`AnimationController`**: A controller that repeats indefinitely (`repeat()`). This provides a value that changes from 0.0 to 1.0 over time.
2.  **`AnimatedBuilder`**: Listens to the controller and rebuilds the `CustomPaint` widget on every frame.
3.  **`CustomPaint`**: The painter rotates the canvas based on the animation value and draws an arc.

In a more complex implementation, we could vary the arc length (sweep angle) to create the "worm" effect seen in Material Design. For this primitive implementation, we rotate a fixed arc to demonstrate the concept of animated custom painting.
