# Animation Demo

Primitive UI components now support implicit animations for smooth state transitions.

## Live Demo

This demo showcases:
- **PrimitiveCard**: Animating color, elevation, and border radius.
- **PrimitiveSlider**: Animating value changes programmatically.

<AppEmbed 
  src="/demo/#/animations" 
  title="Implicit Animations Demo"
  height={700}
/>

## How it works

The animations are built using `TweenAnimationBuilder` and implicit animation patterns, ensuring that state changes result in smooth visual transitions without manual `AnimationController` management for simple properties.
