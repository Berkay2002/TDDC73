# Architecture

Dive deep into how Primitive UI works under the hood. Learn about the primitives, rendering pipeline, and design decisions that shape the library.

## Topics

Explore these architecture topics to understand how Primitive UI is built:

- **[Primitives Explained](/architecture/primitives-explained)** - Learn about CustomPaint, Canvas, RenderBox, and the core building blocks
- **[Rendering Pipeline](/architecture/rendering-pipeline)** - Understand how Flutter transforms widgets into pixels on screen
- **[Design Decisions](/architecture/design-decisions)** - Discover the architectural choices and trade-offs made in Primitive UI

## Why Architecture Matters

Understanding the architecture helps you:

- **Debug effectively** - Know where to look when things go wrong
- **Optimize performance** - Identify bottlenecks and optimization opportunities
- **Extend the library** - Build your own primitive components
- **Learn Flutter deeply** - Gain insights that apply to all Flutter development
